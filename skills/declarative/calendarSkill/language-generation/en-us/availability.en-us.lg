# CheckAvailabilityBusyResponseText(events, time)
- I've found ${count(events)} events for you at ${BuildTime(time)}:

# CheckAvailabilityFreeResponseText(time)
- You don't have anything scheduled for ${BuildTime(time)}. Would you like to reserve this time?

# FoundAvailableTimeResponseText(time)
- I've found a break in your schedule at ${BuildTime(time)}. Would you like to reserve this time?

# FoundNoAvailableTimeResponseText()
- Looks like you don't have any breaks today during working hours.

# AvailabilityList(items)
- ${ExpandableListCardBody(foreach(items, item, if(item.isFreeTime==true, AvailabilityItem(item), ScheduleItem(item))), 5)}

# AvailabilityItem(item)
