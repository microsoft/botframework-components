# You are probably wondering "Why not just run 'yarn exec npm run --if-present test'?".
# On Azure Pipelines, yarn install by default restores modules to a global node_modules cache
# instead of a local package cache. When running the npm CLI, it is unable to resolve required
# dependencies as a result, whereas yarn run <script> can do so successfully. However,
# yarn does not yet have an --if-present condition - the immediate step below simulates this
# by manually reading the package.json and checking for the presence of $.scripts.test in the JSON.
