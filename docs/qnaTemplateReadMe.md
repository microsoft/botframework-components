# QNA Empty Bot Template
Yeoman generator for instantiating a bot template using the generator-empty-bot npm package.

When used in Composer this template will instantiate an instance of the empty bot template and then route the user to add the QNA knowledge base through the Composer client.

The resulting bot template will have an empty bot implementation with a QNA intent configured that routes to the users uploaded QNA knowledge base.
