# Extending your bot with code

# Add custom actions in C#

## In this article

In Bot Framework Composer, [actions](concept-dialog#action) are the main
contents of a [trigger](concept-dialog#trigger). Actions help maintain
conversation flow and instruct bots on how to fulfill user requests.
Composer provides different types of actions, such as **Send a
response**, **Ask a question**, and **Create a condition**. Besides
these built-in actions, you can create and customize your own actions in
Composer.

This article shows you how to include a custom action named
`MultiplyDialog`.

#### Note

Composer currently supports the C\# runtime and JavaScript (preview)
runtime.

## Prerequisites

-   A basic understanding of [actions](concept-dialog#action) in
    Composer.
-   [A basic bot built using Composer](quickstart-create-bot).
-   [Bot Framework CLI
    4.10](https://botbuilder.myget.org/feed/botframework-cli/package/npm/@microsoft/botframework-cli)
    or later.

## Setup the Bot Framework CLI tool
----------------------

The Bot Framework CLI tools include the *bf-dialog* tool which will
create a *schema file* that describes the built-in and custom
capabilities of your bot project. It does this by merging partial schema
files included with each component with the root schema provided by Bot
Framework.

Open a command line and run the following command to install the Bot
Framework tools:

    npm i -g @microsoft/botframework-cli

## About this custom action
----------------------

This C\# custom action consists of the following:

-   A Composer project targeted for Dotnet.  This can be any Composer project.  One that already exists, or a new one you create.  If you want to experiment risk free, create a new Blank Bot in Composer.  This document assumes you create a Blank Bot named "MyBlankBot".

-   The custom action code [MultiplyDialog.cs](assets/MultiplyDialog.cs) class,
    which defines the business logic of the custom action. In this
    example, two numbers passed as inputs are multiplied, and the result
    is the output.

-   The custom action schema [MultiplyDialog.schema](assets/MultiplyDialog.schema), which describes the operations available.

    [Bot Framework
    Schemas](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk/tree/master/schemas)
    are specifications for JSON data. They define the shape of the data
    and can be used to validate JSON. All of Bot Framework's [adaptive
    dialogs](/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-adaptive-dialog-introduction)
    are defined using this JSON schema. The schema files tell Composer
    what capabilities the bot runtime supports. Composer uses the schema
    to help it render the user interface when using the action in a
    dialog. Read the section about [creating schema files in adaptive
    dialogs](/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-dialogs-declarative)
    for more information.

-   A BotComponent, [MultiplyDialogBotComponent.cs](assets/MultiplyDialogBotComponent.cs) code file for component registration.  BotComponents are loaded by your bot (specifically by Adaptive Runtime), and made available to Composer.

    **Note** You can create a custom action without implementing BotComponent.  However, the Component Model in Bot Framework allows for easier reuse and is only slightly more work.

## Adding the custom action to your bot project
------------------------------

1.  Navigate to your Composer bot project folder (eg. C:\MyBlankBot) and create a new folder for the custom action project.  For example, C:\MyBlankBot\MultiplyDialog.

1.  Save [MultiplyDialog.cs](assets/MultiplyDialog.cs), [MultiplyDialog.schema](assets/MultiplyDialog.schema), [MultiplyDialog.csproj](assets/MultiplyDialog.csproj), and [MultiplyDialogBotComponent.cs](assets/MultiplyDialogBotComponent.cs) to this new folder.

1.  Open your Blank Bot solution (C:\MyBlankBot) in Visual Studio.

1.  Add Existing project to the solution.

1.  In the MyBlankBot project, add a project reference to the MultiplyDialog project.  Alternatively, you can add `<ProjectReference Include="..\MultiplyDialog\MultiplyDialog.csproj" />` to the appropriate `ItemGroup` in MyBlankBot.csproj.

1.  Run the command `dotnet build` on the project to
    verify if it passes build after adding custom actions to it. You
    should be able to see the "Build succeeded" message after this
    command.

1. Edit MyBlankBot\settings\appsettings.json to include the MultiplyDialogBotComponent in the `runtimeSettings/components` list.
    ```
    "runtimeSettings": {
        "components": [
        {
            "name": "CustomAction.MultiplyDialog"
        }
    }
    ```

## Update the schema file
----------------------

Now you have customized your bot, the next step is to update the
`sdk.schema` file to include the `MultiplyDialog.Schema` file.  This makes your custom action available for use in Composer.

1) Navigate to the `C:\MyBlankBot\MyBlankBot\schemas` folder. This
folder contains a PowerShell script and a bash script. Run either one of
the following commands:

       ./update-schema.ps1

    **Note**

    You can validate that the partial schema (`MultiplyDialog.schema` inside
    the `CustomAction\Schema` folder) has been appended to the default
    `sdk.schema` file to generate one single consolidated `sdk.schema` file.

    The above steps should generate a new `sdk.schema` file inside the
    `schemas` folder for Composer to use. Reload the bot and you should be
    able to include your custom action.

1) Search `MultiplyDialog` inside the `MyBlankBot\schemas\sdk.schema` file and
    validate that the partial schema (`MultiplyDialog.schema` inside the
    `customaction` folder has been appended to the default `sdk.schema`
    file (`MyBlankBot\schemas\sdk.schema`) to generate one single consolidated
    `sdk.schema` file.

### Tip

Alternatively, you can select the `update-schema.sh` file inside the
`MyBlankBot\schemas` folder to run the bash script. You can't click and run the
`powershell` file directly.

## Test
----

Reopen the bot project in Composer and you should be able to test your
added custom action.

1.  Open your bot in Composer. Select a trigger you want to associate
    this custom action with.

2.  Select **+** under the trigger node to see the actions menu. You
    will see **Custom Actions** added to the menu. Select **Multiply**
    from the menu.

3.  On the **Properties** panel on the right side, enter two numbers in
    the argument fields: **Arg1** and **Arg2**. Enter **dialog.result**
    in the **Result** property field. For example, you can enter the
    following:

4.  Add a **Send a response** action. Enter `99*99=${dialog.result}` in
    the Language Generation editor.

5.  Select **Restart Bot** to test the bot in the Emulator. Your bot
    will respond with the test result.
