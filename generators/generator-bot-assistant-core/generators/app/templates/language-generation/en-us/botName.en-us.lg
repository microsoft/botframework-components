# whichOneDidYouMean()
- I'm not sure which one you mean.
- Hmmm, I find that to be ambiguous.

# pickOne()
- Can you pick one ?
- Can you help clarify by choosing one ?

# getAnswerReadBack()
- See an answer from the Knowledge Base

# getIntentReadBack()
- SWITCH : ${toLower(dialog.luisResult.intent)}
- CASE : ${'GetUserProfile'}
  - Start filling in your profile(GetUserProfile intent)
- DEFAULT :
  - ${dialog.luisResult.intent}
