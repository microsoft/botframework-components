# @microsoft/generator-bot-command-list [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
> Yeoman generator for creating an Adaptive bot built on the Azure Bot Framework using the Command List template.

This template instantiates a bot built around a set of commands rather than a language recognizer. Includes cards with message back actions for example commands "hello" and "help."

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and @microsoft/generator-bot-command-list using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g @microsoft/generator-bot-command-list
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo @microsoft/bot-command-list '{BOT_NAME}'
```

## Packages

## Languages
