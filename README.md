# Bot Framework Components

This repository contains *components* published by Microsoft for bots built on the Azure Bot Framework technology stack. They are part of the component model for building bots with re-usable building blocks. The model is built on a configurable [adaptive runtime](#adaptive-runtime), that can be extended by adding your own code, importing [packages](#packages) of functionality or connecting to other bots as [skills](#skills). Getting started [templates](#templates) provide dynamic code scaffolding, helping users get started quickly based on their scenario.

## Using Components

You'll primarily use components through [**Bot Framework Composer**](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-Composer) - our visual bot authoring canvas for developers. From Composer you can add and remove packages from your bot, and the creation process creates bots built from the templates here.

## Creating your own components

You can also create your own packages and templates for use from Composer. We document creating components [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/composer/concept-packages). You can also check out [our samples](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/main/composer-samples).

### Templates

Templates are pre-built bot projects designed for specific scenarios. We use [yeoman](https://yeoman.io) generators for scaffolding our templates.
