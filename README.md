# Bot Framework Components

This repository contains the source code for *components* published by Microsoft for bots built on the Azure Bot Framework technology stack. These components are part of the component model for building bots, which enables developers to build bots with re-usable building blocks (components). This model consists of a configurable [adaptive runtime](#adaptive-runtime), that can be extended by importing [packages](#packages) of functionality or connecting to other bots as [skills](#skills). Getting started [templates](#templates) built on this model will unify the creation experience, and eliminate the "dead-end" that can happen for some existing getting started experiences that lock you in to building a particular type of bot.

**Our goals**:

* Encourage the reuse of bot components â€“ either connecting to a skill or importing in a package.
* Enable the free movement of bots and components across hosting options and editing canvases.
* Use industry/language-standard concepts and tools wherever possible.
* Abstract away platform concepts for developers who do not wish to use them directly.
* Enable provisioning and deployment to the necessary infrastructure based on the components included in a bot.
* Publish a suite of packages, templates, and skills bot developers can use to build their bots from.
* Publish components that demonstrate conversational design best practices.
